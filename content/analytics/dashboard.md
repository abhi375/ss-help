### Overview

The Analytics section is used to get reports and analyze the performance of teams. It can be used to assess the productivity of an agent/team, identify the service level of a team, get the count of abandoned calls at a particular interval, connected calls, etc.

You can export a conversation report containing call detail records for a particular interval in the form of a CSV. Every report is then exportable.

Managers can create dashboards for call, chat, and agent metrics, using panels from the Insights sidebar.

You can create Insights from the sidebar, based on 3 categories: Sessions, Activities and CSAT. Each panel can be customized separately.

**Sessions**
Overall Team/User statistics in relation to conversations

**Activities**
Information about agent login/logout and productivity

**CSAT**
Insights on CSAT performance

To customize the display, the user simply has to drag and drop the panel onto the dashboard from the list on the right.
